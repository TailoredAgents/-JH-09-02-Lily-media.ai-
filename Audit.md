## Phase 03: API & Middleware Wiring

### Executive Summary
Robust API architecture with centralized router registry, comprehensive security middleware, and proper operational endpoints. Strong CORS policies and rate limiting implemented.

### Architecture Overview
1. **Centralized Router Registry**: `backend.api._registry.ROUTERS` provides single source of truth
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when routers fail to load
3. **Security Middleware**: HSTS, CSP, rate limiting, trusted hosts
4. **Operational Endpoints**: Health checks, metrics, file uploads

### Key Features

#### ✅ Security Posture
- **Proxy headers**: Proper reverse-proxy header handling
- **Rate limiting**: Redis-backed with in-memory fallback
- **CORS policy**: Strict production configuration, localhost blocked
- **Security headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.

#### ✅ Operational Readiness
- Multiple health check endpoints (`/health`, `/render-health`)
- Metrics endpoint for monitoring
- Static file serving for uploads
- Generic CORS preflight handling

### Fallback Routes
When core routers fail to load, the system provides fallback endpoints:
- `/api/metrics` - Empty metrics payload
- `/api/notifications/` - Basic notification list
- `/api/system/logs` - System log access
- `/api/workflow/status/summary` - Workflow status
- `/api/autonomous/research/latest` - Research data

### Recommendations
- Ensure production environments disable stubs/fallbacks
- Implement startup health gates for critical router failures
- Add CI/CD checks for OpenAPI schema diffs
- Verify Redis-backed rate limiting in production

## Phase 04: Schema, Migrations & Multi-Tenancy

### Executive Summary
Solid foundation with plans model and multi-tenant architecture, but significant schema drift and missing features require immediate attention.

### Critical Findings

#### 🚨 Schema Drift
The `user_settings` table is missing numerous ORM-defined fields:
- `image_mood` (JSONB)
- `brand_keywords` (JSONB) 
- `avoid_list` (JSONB)
- `preferred_image_style` (JSONB)
- `custom_image_prompts` (JSONB)
- `image_quality` (VARCHAR)
- `image_aspect_ratio` (VARCHAR)
- `creativity_level` (INTEGER)
- `enable_auto_image_generation` (BOOLEAN)
- `enable_repurposing` (BOOLEAN)

#### 🚨 Missing Features
- `default_image_model` field not implemented
- `style_vault` (JSONB) for brand consistency not implemented
- Required GIN indexes for JSONB columns missing

#### 🚨 Vector Memory Alignment
**Critical mismatch**: Database configured for 3072-dimension vectors (text-embedding-3-large) but runtime defaults to 1536 dimensions.

#### 🚨 Migration Continuity
- Missing `016_open_saas_auth` migration creates broken revision chain
- Security hotfix `999_add_org_id_content_log` branches from missing node

### Multi-Tenancy Status
- Most tables properly include `organization_id`/`user_id` fields
- Usage records have composite indexes for billing/reporting
- Content logs security hotfix adds organization scoping

### Style Vault Specification
The `style_vault` JSONB column will store curated visual identity:
```json
{
  "palettes": [{"name": "Primary", "colors": ["#3b82f6"], "usage": "background"}],
  "fonts": [{"family": "Montserrat", "weights": [400,700], "usage": "headings"}],
  "textures": [{"name": "Paper", "description": "Subtle paper grain"}],
  "influencers": [{"reference_url": "https://example.com/guide.png"}],
  "rules": {"avoid_colors": ["#ff0000"], "prefer_compositions": ["rule_of_thirds"]}
}
```

### Required Migrations
1. **Revision 032**: Expand user_settings columns
2. **Revision 033**: Add default_image_model and style_vault with GIN index
3. **Fix migration continuity**: Supply missing 016 revision or rebase
4. **Vector alignment**: Configure runtime to use 3072 dimensions

2. **CSRF Exposure**: SameSite=None cookies vulnerable on cookie-only endpoints
3. **Distributed Rate Limits**: In-memory stores won't work across multiple instances
4. **Account Enumeration**: Timing and error message inconsistencies

### Abuse Resistance

#### Rate Limiting
- **Global per-IP**: Redis-backed with in-memory fallback
- **Per-user throttling**: JWT validation caches
- **Endpoint-level**: Sensitive routes protected

#### Security Controls
- Token blacklisting and rotation
- Password strength validation
- TOTP 2FA with backup codes
- Admin lockout mechanisms
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Required Security Hardening

#### MUST Fix
1. **Add CSRF tokens** to cookie-only endpoints (`/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`)
2. **Migrate to Redis** for all endpoint rate limiters
3. **Address XSS risk**: Move access tokens from localStorage or implement strict CSP

#### SHOULD Fix
1. **Normalize auth errors** to prevent account enumeration
2. **Tighten CORS** to explicit origins only
3. **Add session validation** to refresh/logout flows

Comprehensive standardization for image generation with type safety and versioning:

**Core Fields**:
- `prompt` (required), `negative_prompt`, `model` (auto/grok2_basic/grok2_premium/gpt_image_1)
- `quality` (draft/standard/premium/story/banner) with plan-based caps
- `platform`, `tone`, `industry_context`, `content_context`

**Personalization Fields**:
- `mood`, `visual_style`, `primary_color` (#hex validation), `secondary_color`
- `brand_keywords`, `avoid_list`, `reference_images`, `seed`
- `max_retries`, `custom_options`, `enable_post_processing`, `generate_alt_text`

**Safety & Compliance**:
- `nsfw_filter` (default: true), `privacy_mode` (allow/blur/disallow)
- `max_latency_ms`, `compliance_tags`, `version: 1`

#### ✅ Helper Functions
- `render_prompt(contract, model)` - Template selection and rendering
- `extract_negative_prompt(contract)` - Merge negative_prompt + avoid_list
- `apply_personalisation(contract, user_settings)` - User defaults integration

- **Policy conflict**: `.content-policy.md` explicitly bans DALL-E usage
- **Code violations**: `dalle3` identifiers exist in plan configurations
- **Required action**: Complete removal of DALL-E references and plan mappings

##### Dispatcher Implementation Gaps
- **Hard-coded Grok-2**: `ImageGenerationService.generate_image()` only calls Grok-2
- **Unused effective_model**: PlanAware service computes but doesn't use effective model
- **Missing router**: No model dispatch to `_generate_with_grok2()` / `_generate_with_gpt_image1()`
- **No policy enforcement**: Router doesn't block prohibited models

#### 🚨 Quality Assurance Deficiencies

##### Missing Advanced Scoring
- **No CLIP/LAION**: Basic resolution checks instead of aesthetic/semantic alignment
- **No object detection**: Missing face/object validation capabilities
- **No negative validation**: No checks for banned content in generated images
- **Missing text fallback**: No graceful degradation after quality failures

##### Plan Enforcement Gaps
- **Static thresholds**: No plan-aware quality requirements
- **Missing usage tracking**: Monthly image generation limits not enforced
- **No capability mapping**: User quality preferences not translated to API parameters

### API Call Patterns
**Grok-2**: `await async_client.images.generate(model="grok-2-image", prompt=..., n=1, response_format="b64_json")`

**GPT Image 1**: `await openai.images.generate(model="gpt-image-1", prompt=..., n, size, response_format="b64_json", negative_prompt=...)`

**DALL-E 3**: *Prohibited by content policy*

### Image Generation Pipeline Flow
```mermaid
User Request → PlanAware Check → Contract Creation → Model Router → 
API Generation → Quality Validation → Post-Processing → Alt-Text → 
S3 Storage → Metadata Persistence → Return URL & Metrics
```

### Personalization Mapping
| UserSetting | PromptContract | Usage |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| brand_voice | tone | Template tone & alt-text |
| visual_style | visual_style | Style adjectives in prompt |
| primary/secondary_color | colors | Palette hints |
| industry_type | industry_context | Subject guidance |
| image_mood | mood | Mood string combination |

- **Multi-tenant queries**: Potential N+1 queries without proper organization_id filtering
- **Index optimization**: Missing composite indexes for common query patterns
- **Connection pooling**: Scaling limitations with current connection management
- **Cache utilization**: Redis cache efficiency not measured or optimized

### Vector Memory Capacity Planning

#### Current Configuration Assessment
**100k Vector Baseline**:
- **Memory requirement**: ~1.17GB RAM for vector index
- **Embedding model**: text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions)
- **Index type**: `IndexFlatIP` for cosine similarity
- **Persistence overhead**: Additional storage for metadata and mapping files

#### Scale Projections
**10k Users Scenario** (estimated):
- **Vector count**: ~1M vectors (100 per user average)
- **Memory requirement**: ~11.7GB RAM for FAISS index
- **Storage requirement**: Significant pgvector table growth
- **Batch processing**: Increased embedding API costs and rate limit pressure

#### Optimization Recommendations
1. **Vector pruning**: Implement stale embedding cleanup and per-tenant caps
2. **Dynamic saves**: Trigger index saves after significant bulk inserts, not just hourly
3. **Batch optimization**: Configure 32-64 vector batches balancing rate limits and costs
4. **Tenant partitioning**: Consider pgvector table partitioning for very large datasets

- `ConnectionPublisherService`: Per-platform publishing with audit logging

#### ❌ Identified Vulnerabilities
**Policy Enforcement Gaps**:
- `plan_model_access` contains banned `dalle3` model references
- No runtime policy validation in image generation router
- API schemas expose prohibited model options

**Security Bypass Issues**:  
- Legacy social connection endpoints skip `PlanAwareSocialService` validation
- Platform allowlist and connection limit enforcement can be circumvented
- Inconsistent authorization patterns between legacy and modern endpoints

### Launch Remediation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Critical Blocker Resolution (Required for GO Decision)
1. **Eliminate DALL-E Policy Violations**:
   - Remove all `dalle3` references from plan configurations and API schemas
   - Implement policy guard in image generation router with hard-fail logic
   - Add CI linter to prevent future policy violations
   - Regenerate OpenAPI documentation without banned models

2. **Secure Legacy Social Connect Flow**:
   - Deprecate legacy social connection endpoints or wrap with proper validation
   - Ensure all social connection paths utilize `PlanAwareSocialService`
   - Unify authentication and authorization patterns with modern `/api/social-auth`
   - Add integration tests validating plan limit enforcement

3. **Verification Requirements**:
   - Execute static analysis confirming no DALL-E references
   - Run runtime tests validating policy enforcement in router
   - Test legacy social connection paths for plan gating compliance
   - Execute complete golden path smoke tests on staging environment

#### Phase 2: Medium Priority Security Improvements (Post-Launch)
1. **Research Job Plan Enforcement**: Add plan/usage gating to research automation
2. **Analytics Authentication**: Require authentication for all dashboard endpoints
3. **Enhanced Rate Limiting**: Implement 2FA attempt throttling with exponential backoff
4. **Observability Enhancement**: Expand metrics/tracing coverage for critical operations

### Launch Decision Framework

#### GO Criteria (Must Complete All)
- [ ] **Policy Compliance**: Zero DALL-E references confirmed via static analysis
- [ ] **Social Security**: All connection endpoints enforce plan limits
- [ ] **Runtime Validation**: Policy enforcement confirmed in image router
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Golden path smoke tests pass on staging
- [ ] **Security Review**: Legacy bypass vulnerabilities resolved

#### Current Status: **NO-GO**
**Justification**: Two high-severity security and compliance issues prevent safe production deployment. The platform architecture is sound and the golden path is fully implemented, but critical policy violations and security bypasses require resolution before launch.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Remediate high-severity blockers listed above
2. Re-execute security and policy audits
3. Complete staging environment validation  
4. Upon successful remediation verification, promote to **GO** status
