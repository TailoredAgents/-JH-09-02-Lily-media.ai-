# Container Security Policy
**Lily Media AI Platform - Container Security Standards & Enforcement**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025  
**Owner:** Security, Infrastructure & Backend Systems Team

---

## Policy Overview

This document defines the container security requirements and enforcement mechanisms for the Lily Media AI platform. All container images must comply with these security standards before deployment to production environments.

### Scope
- All containerized applications (backend, frontend, workers)
- Container images built in CI/CD pipelines
- Third-party container images used as base layers
- Container runtime security configurations

---

## Security Requirements

### 1. Vulnerability Scanning Requirements

#### Mandatory Scanning
```yaml
Vulnerability Scanning Requirements:
  ✅ Critical Vulnerabilities: Zero tolerance (BLOCK deployment)
  ✅ High Vulnerabilities: Maximum 10 allowed (with justification)
  ✅ Medium Vulnerabilities: Maximum 50 allowed
  ✅ Low Vulnerabilities: No limit (monitoring only)

Scanning Tools:
  ✅ Primary: Trivy (Aqua Security)
  ✅ Secondary: Snyk (for additional coverage)
  ✅ Integration: GitHub Security Advisory Database
  ✅ SARIF Output: Required for GitHub Security tab integration
```

#### Scan Coverage Requirements
```yaml
Required Scan Types:
  ✅ Container Image Vulnerabilities: Operating system packages
  ✅ Application Dependencies: Language-specific packages (pip, npm)
  ✅ Filesystem Analysis: Static analysis of container contents
  ✅ Configuration Issues: Dockerfile and container config analysis
  ✅ Secret Detection: Embedded credentials and API keys
  ✅ License Compliance: Open source license validation
```

### 2. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Requirements

#### SBOM Generation Standards
```yaml
SBOM Requirements:
  ✅ Format: SPDX 2.3 + CycloneDX 1.4 (dual format)
  ✅ Coverage: 100% of application dependencies
  ✅ Metadata: Package names, versions, licenses, checksums
  ✅ Provenance: Build system and toolchain information
  ✅ Relationships: Dependency tree and relationships
  ✅ Attestation: Digital signatures for integrity verification

Generation Process:
  ✅ Automated: Generated during container build process
  ✅ Storage: Stored as build artifacts and container attestations
  ✅ Retention: 90 days for audit and compliance purposes
  ✅ Access: Available to security and compliance teams
```

#### SBOM Content Requirements
```yaml
Required SBOM Components:
  Backend (Python):
    ✅ pip packages: All installed Python packages
    ✅ System packages: OS-level dependencies
    ✅ Base image: Python runtime and OS components
    ✅ Application code: Internal package metadata

  Frontend (Node.js):
    ✅ npm packages: All production dependencies
    ✅ Build artifacts: Compiled JavaScript bundles
    ✅ Static assets: Images, fonts, configuration files
    ✅ Web server: Nginx or equivalent configuration
```

### 3. Container Hardening Requirements

#### Base Image Requirements
```yaml
Base Image Standards:
  ✅ Official Images: Use official vendor images only
  ✅ Minimal Images: Prefer slim/alpine variants
  ✅ Version Pinning: Pin to specific version tags (not 'latest')
  ✅ Digest Pinning: Pin by SHA256 digest for immutability
  ✅ Regular Updates: Update base images monthly
  ✅ Vulnerability-Free: Base images must pass security scans
```

#### Runtime Security Configuration
```yaml
Container Security Configuration:
  ✅ Non-Root User: Run as dedicated non-privileged user
  ✅ Read-Only Filesystem: Set root filesystem as read-only
  ✅ No Privileged Mode: Never run containers in privileged mode
  ✅ Limited Capabilities: Drop all capabilities, add only required
  ✅ Resource Limits: Set CPU and memory limits
  ✅ Network Policies: Implement network segmentation
  ✅ Security Context: Configure appropriate security context
```

#### Dockerfile Security Standards
```dockerfile
# Required Dockerfile Security Patterns:

# 1. Multi-stage builds for minimal attack surface
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# ... build steps ...

FROM python:3.11-slim as production
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# 2. Non-root user creation
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
USER appuser

# 3. Explicit package versions and cleanup
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    package1=1.2.3 \
    package2=4.5.6 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && apt-get clean

# 4. Health checks for reliability
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# 5. Security labels and metadata
LABEL security.scan="required" \
      maintainer="security@lilymedia.ai" \
      version="1.0.0"
```

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. CI/CD Security Gates

#### Automated Security Checks
```yaml
Pre-Build Gates:
  ✅ Dockerfile Linting: hadolint validation
  ✅ Secret Scanning: Prevent embedded credentials
  ✅ Base Image Validation: Verify approved base images

Build-Time Gates:
  ✅ Vulnerability Scanning: Trivy container scan
  ✅ SBOM Generation: Automatic SBOM creation
  ✅ Security Threshold: Enforce vulnerability limits
  ✅ Compliance Check: License and policy validation

Post-Build Gates:
  ✅ Image Signing: Cosign digital signatures
  ✅ Registry Push: Only signed, verified images
  ✅ Attestation: Attach SBOMs and scan results
  ✅ Deployment Approval: Security team approval for production
```

#### Gate Failure Responses
```yaml
Security Gate Failures:
  Critical Vulnerabilities Found:
    Action: BLOCK deployment immediately
    Notification: Security team + developer
    Resolution: Patch vulnerabilities or use alternative packages

  High Vulnerability Threshold Exceeded:
    Action: BLOCK deployment until review
    Notification: Security team for risk assessment
    Resolution: Security exception or vulnerability remediation

  SBOM Generation Failed:
    Action: BLOCK deployment
    Notification: Build team + developer
    Resolution: Fix SBOM generation process

  Container Hardening Issues:
    Action: BLOCK deployment
    Notification: Developer + security team
    Resolution: Update Dockerfile to meet standards
```

### 2. Monitoring and Compliance

#### Continuous Security Monitoring
```yaml
Runtime Monitoring:
  ✅ Vulnerability Database Updates: Daily updates from threat feeds
  ✅ Zero-Day Response: Immediate scanning when new vulnerabilities published
  ✅ Compliance Reporting: Weekly security posture reports
  ✅ Trend Analysis: Track vulnerability trends and improvement metrics

Compliance Validation:
  ✅ SBOM Completeness: Verify all components are cataloged
  ✅ License Compliance: Check for license violations
  ✅ Audit Trail: Maintain complete security audit logs
  ✅ Incident Response: Automated response to security events
```

#### Security Metrics and KPIs
```yaml
Security Metrics:
  ✅ Mean Time to Patch (MTTP): Target <7 days for high severity
  ✅ Vulnerability Density: Track vulnerabilities per container image
  ✅ SBOM Coverage: Maintain 100% dependency visibility
  ✅ Security Gate Success Rate: Target >95% first-pass success
  ✅ False Positive Rate: Minimize security scanning noise
  ✅ Compliance Score: Overall security posture measurement
```
