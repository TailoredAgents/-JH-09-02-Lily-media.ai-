## Usage Guide

### Local Development

#### Basic Migration with Guardrails
```bash
# Set your database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname"

# Check current migration status
make migration-status

# Run migration dry run (no changes)
make migration-dry-run

# Execute safe migration with backups
make migration-safe
```

#### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# List available rollback points
make migration-list-backups

# Validate a specific rollback point
make migration-validate-rollback MIGRATION_ID=migration_20250906_123456

# Perform emergency rollback (destructive!)
make migration-emergency-rollback MIGRATION_ID=migration_20250906_123456
```

### Production Deployment

The migration guardrails are automatically integrated into the production deployment workflow:

```yaml
# Triggered automatically during production deployment
- name: Run safe database migration
  uses: ./.github/workflows/safe-migration.yml
  with:
    environment: 'production'
    target_revision: 'head'
    dry_run: false
  secrets:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL }}
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Pre-Migration Validation

**Database Connectivity**
- Verifies database connection is healthy
- Validates Alembic configuration
- Checks for migration file integrity

**Schema State Validation**
- Captures current schema hash for integrity checking
- Records current Alembic head revision
- Validates pending migration files

### 2. Automated Backup System

**Full Database Backup**
- Complete PostgreSQL dump using `pg_dump`
- Includes schema, data, and metadata
- Compressed and timestamped backup files

**Backup Verification**
- File size validation (non-empty backups)
- Integrity checks before proceeding
- Storage location verification

**Backup Retention**
- Configurable retention policies
- Automated cleanup of old backups
- Minimum retention of 10 most recent backups

### 3. Migration Context Tracking

**Comprehensive Metadata**
```json
{
  "migration_id": "migration_20250906_123456",
  "backup_path": "/path/to/backup.sql",
  "pre_migration_schema_hash": "abc123...",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-06T23:45:00Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "alembic_head_before": "revision_abc123",
  "database_url": "postgresql://...",
  "backup_size_bytes": 1048576,
  "migration_files": ["001_add_user_table.py"]
}
```

### 4. Rollback Capabilities

**Automatic Rollback Triggers**
- Migration execution failure
- Post-migration verification failure
- Database connectivity loss
- Schema corruption detection

**Manual Emergency Rollback**
- Available via CLI tools and Makefile commands
- Comprehensive safety validation before rollback
- Creates emergency backup before rollback
- Complete audit trail of rollback operations

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `safe-migration.yml` workflow provides:

- **Environment-specific configuration** (staging/production)
- **Automatic backup creation** before migrations
- **Post-migration validation** with health checks
- **Artifact retention** for backup files and logs
- **Failure notifications** with rollback instructions

### Deployment Integration

Production deployments automatically use migration guardrails:

1. **Pre-deployment validation** ensures safety
2. **Automated backup creation** before migration
3. **Safe migration execution** with guardrails
4. **Post-migration verification** confirms success
5. **Automatic rollback** on any failure

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Database credentials** stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- **Backup files** protected with appropriate permissions
- **Migration scripts** require explicit confirmation for destructive operations

### Audit Trail

- **Complete migration history** with timestamps and context
- **Backup creation logs** for compliance and debugging
- **Rollback operation records** for incident response
- **Integration with monitoring** for real-time alerts

### Data Protection

- **Encrypted backup storage** in production environments
- **Retention policies** comply with data governance requirements
- **Access logging** for all migration and rollback operations

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Success Metrics

- **Migration success rate** (target: >99%)
- **Backup creation success** (target: 100%)
- **Rollback test success** (target: 100%)
- **Recovery time objective** (target: <15 minutes)

### Alert Conditions

- **Migration failure** - Immediate alert to on-call team
- **Backup failure** - Block deployment until resolved
- **Rollback activation** - Emergency alert with context
- **Storage capacity** - Proactive alerts at 80% capacity

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Migration Timeout**
```bash
# Symptoms: Migration hangs or times out
# Solution: Check database locks, increase timeout, or run during maintenance window
make migration-status  # Check for blocking processes
```

**Backup Creation Failure**
```bash
# Symptoms: Cannot create backup before migration
# Solution: Check disk space, permissions, and database connectivity
df -h  # Check disk space
```

**Rollback Validation Failure**
```bash
# Symptoms: Cannot validate rollback point
# Solution: Check backup file integrity and migration context
make migration-validate-rollback MIGRATION_ID=<id>
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Manual Recovery from Backup**
```bash
# If automated rollback fails, manual recovery may be necessary
pg_restore -d $DATABASE_URL /path/to/backup.sql
```

**Schema Integrity Check**
```bash
# Verify database schema integrity after recovery
python -c "
import hashlib
# Compare schema hashes to detect corruption
"
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Always test migrations** on staging before production
2. **Use dry-run mode** to validate migration logic
3. **Review migration files** for potential issues
4. **Coordinate with team** for complex migrations

### Production Deployment

1. **Schedule migrations** during low-traffic periods
2. **Monitor system health** during and after migration
3. **Keep rollback plan ready** for quick recovery
4. **Communicate with stakeholders** about maintenance windows

### Emergency Response

1. **Assess impact** quickly when issues arise
2. **Use automated rollback** as first response
3. **Document incidents** for post-mortem analysis
4. **Update procedures** based on lessons learned
