## üîß Implementation Details

### Automated Cleanup Process

The data retention system implements automated cleanup for categories where `automatic_cleanup: true`:

1. **Daily Scheduled Jobs**: Background tasks check for expired data daily at 2:00 AM UTC
2. **Graduated Cleanup**: Data is moved to cold storage before final deletion where applicable
3. **Audit Trail**: All cleanup operations are logged for compliance tracking
4. **Error Handling**: Failed cleanup operations are retried with exponential backoff
5. **Notifications**: Administrators receive reports on cleanup operations

### Manual Review Process

Categories with `automatic_cleanup: false` require manual administrative review:

1. **User Profile Data**: Account deletion requires manual verification
2. **Audit Logs**: Compliance officer review for regulatory requirements
3. **Security Data**: Security team review for ongoing investigations

### Legal Hold Process

When legal holds are applied:

1. **Automatic Suspension**: Cleanup is suspended for affected data
2. **Legal Hold Exempt**: Some categories (audit logs, security data) cannot be placed on legal hold
3. **Documentation**: All legal holds are documented with justification and timeline
4. **Release Process**: Legal holds are released only with legal team approval

### Data Export Before Deletion

Before automated cleanup:

1. **Aggregation**: Key metrics are aggregated for historical reporting
2. **Archival**: Important data patterns are preserved in anonymized form
3. **Compliance Export**: Data subject to legal requirements is exported to compliance archives
