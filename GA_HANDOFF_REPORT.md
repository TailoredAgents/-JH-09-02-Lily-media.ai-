- Basic user settings integration in `build_prompt_with_user_settings()`

**Required Changes:**
1. Create `backend/services/prompt_contract.py` with Pydantic models
2. Add model templates in `backend/services/templates/` directory
3. Implement `backend/services/model_router.py` with AUTO/GROK2/GPTIMG1 enum
4. Integrate CLIP aesthetic scoring for quality validation
5. Replace hard-coded prompts with contract-based rendering

**File Locations to Modify:**
- `backend/services/image_generation_service.py:316-560` (generate_image method)
- `backend/db/models.py:193-256` (UserSetting model expansion)

### Section 2: Plan-Based Feature Implementation

**Current Implementation:**
- `User.tier` field exists in `backend/db/models.py:28`
- No plan enforcement anywhere in codebase
- No billing integration beyond Stripe field definitions

**Required Changes:**
1. Create `Plan` table migration with Starter/Pro/Enterprise data
2. Implement `backend/services/plan_service.py` with capability methods
3. Add plan checks to image generation, connections, team management
4. Frontend plan gates and upgrade prompts
5. Stripe integration with subscription management

**File Locations to Create:**
- `backend/db/models.py` (Plan model addition)
- `backend/services/plan_service.py`
- `backend/api/billing.py`
- `frontend/src/pages/Billing.jsx`

### Section 3: Autonomous System Enhancement

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic scheduling in `backend/tasks/autonomous_scheduler.py`
- Content generation in `backend/services/autonomous_posting.py`
- Uses `openai_tool.create_image()` instead of enhanced pipeline

**Required Changes:**
1. Replace image generation call with enhanced service
2. Add plan capability checking before executing cycles
3. Implement posting frequency limits based on user plan
