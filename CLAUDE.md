üöø **PRESSURE WASHING IMPLEMENTATION**: See PRESSURE_WASHING_TODO.md for all features to implement
- When working on pressure washing features, ALWAYS check PRESSURE_WASHING_TODO.md first
- Update PRESSURE_WASHING_TODO.md as you plan and implement features
- Use PRESSURE_WASHING_TODO.md for multi-agent coordination

- Only write production-ready code, no mock, fake, demo, or placeholder code
- Always write production ready code
- Never create mock data, designs, or code
- when making edits or additions, check any related API endpoints and ensure all are properly connected
- when finished make changes, test build, commit to remote git repo
- Unless explicity required, you (claude) will do everything you can to avoid manual intervention during the process of fixing, update, or editing this project

- **PRESSURE WASHING FEATURES**: Always check PRESSURE_WASHING_TODO.md for implementation status
- research the internet to confirm the proper way to fix or produce what youre working on
- Guardrail: production-ready only ‚Äî no mock/fake/demo data in app code or migrations; mocks allowed in tests only; scan & confirm no banned patterns in the diff.
- Never create placeholder files
- Always write production ready code
- Always create valid and proper endpoints
- Never use mock data
- Never write mock code
- Always test build before commit
- Always commit to https://github.com/TailoredAgents/-JH-09-02-Lily-media.ai-.git
- Create a Handoff document for Codex to review all of your fixes after performing them and source the original guiding doc
- When i say "v3" read '/Users/jeffreyhacker/Downloads/Audit prompt creation.pdf' '/Users/jeffreyhacker/Downloads/TailoredAgents Lily Media AI ‚Äì Feature Audit and Recommendations.pdf'\
and '/Users/jeffreyhacker/Downloads/Git project review.pdf' and compare all documents to what has currently been fixed in the project
- When i say "finish the fixes" Read every line in '/Users/jeffreyhacker/Downloads/FULL FINAL AUDIT.pdf' and determine what still needs to be done
