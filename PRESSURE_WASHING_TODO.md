## üöÄ Implementation Approach

### Recommended Multi-Agent Strategy

1. **Planning Agent**: Analyze requirements and create detailed implementation plans
2. **Backend Agent**: Implement API endpoints and business logic
3. **AI Training Agent**: Prepare datasets and train models for pressure washing
4. **Integration Agent**: Connect with external services (Housecall Pro, weather APIs)
5. **Frontend Agent**: Update UI components for pressure washing features
6. **Testing Agent**: Validate all features work correctly
7. **Documentation Agent**: Keep docs in sync with implementation

### Daily Update Protocol

**Morning**:
- Review this TODO file
- Select tasks for the day
- Update status to "IN PROGRESS"

**During Development**:
- Add any discovered subtasks
- Note blockers or dependencies
- Update completion percentages

**End of Day**:
- Mark completed tasks
- Add notes about tomorrow's priorities
- Update the "Last Updated" date

## üìù Notes for Development Team

### Critical Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Ensure all customer data from social media is handled securely
2. **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting for all social platforms
3. **Scalability**: Design for multi-tenant architecture from the start
4. **Testing**: Every feature needs unit tests and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Update API docs as features are built

### Current Blockers

- [ ] Need API keys for Housecall Pro
- [ ] Need API keys for Jobber
- [ ] Weather API selection (OpenWeather, Weather.com, etc.)
- [ ] Training data collection for pressure washing terminology

### Questions to Resolve

1. How should we handle different pricing models (per sq ft, flat rate, hourly)?
2. Which weather API provides the best rain prediction accuracy?
3. Should we support metric units for international expansion?
4. How many days ahead should we check weather for scheduling?
5. What's the minimum confidence threshold for auto-responding to DMs?
